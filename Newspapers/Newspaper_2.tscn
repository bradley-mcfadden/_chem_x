text = "    In a recent development, leading chemical engineers at ShakenNotStirred Co. have developed manufacturing technology that allows simple chemical reactions to be performed without a large amount of dedicated equipment to do so. 
	    Industry leaders have commented that this will make the chemical production business substantial more efficient, and allow small businesses to pivot on what they produce, potentially make a number of products at a much lower cost.
		    Locally, the newly created Chem-X Inc. is looking to incorporate these machines into their facilities."

text = "    When Deep Blue defeated reigning chess world champion Garry Kasparov in 1997, or when the Roombas rolled through dining rooms across the first, a question becoming increasing relevant is: To what extent will robots be automation reach? What are the limits of the jobs that robots can take?
	    We spoke with experts in the field, and there are essentially two types of jobs, algorithmic and prbblem solving tasks. Algorithmic tasks are perfect for automation. This is primarily because their problems require many operations on data, which computers are good at doing.
		    A group of problems that is not so easy for a computer to solve would be pattern recognition, or solving skill based games with very complex decision trees. Howeber, as seen in the past, machine learning and more sophisticated algoritms have been used to overcome these shortcomings to a certain point."
