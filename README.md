# Chem-X



Chem-X was a game demo for an automation centered game that I created for a project in my third year of university.
The idea was that you would play as a process engineer and be given a particular set of items to create as well as
some output rate goals that you had to reach. The gameplay was somewhat puzzle like, as you had to combine your various
machines in the limited space efficiently in order to reach the goals.

The actual implementation had a number of problems - and that's ok! This was only ever thrown together in abuot 3 months.
Of the work I did on this project, I'm happiest with some of the custom UI components that were created for it, including
a working hamburger menu. Another area I thought was implemented well was that the recipes in the game are specified in data
files -- not at all in the actual code of the game, which allows for the game to be easily extensible for others.

The most troublesome implementation was the creation of convey belts, which look bad and are very inefficient to run. 
Additionally, some of the media files should have used different containers or codecs in order to save space. The final binary
of the game was quite big for the handful of levels it was. If I were to ever revisit this, I'd have a lot of organization work
to do first.
